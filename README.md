# C128-A-V-Adapter
An A/V-adaptor board for the Commodore C128. This board is intended to connect to the Commodore C128 and use standard cables (audio, composite with RCA connector and/or s-video with a mini-DIN cable).

It also provides a 330Ohm resistor, which attenuates the s-video chroma line. This resistor can be bridged with a jumper.

Also an optional stereo output on pin 7 of the a/v jack (stereo sid, FPGA SID etc.) can be connected to the right audio channel. By default, this channel is also connected to the (mono) audio output.

# Rev. 1
This revision was required due to the obsolescence of the Lumberg BTOR1 RCA jacks. CUI Inc. RCJ-02* type conectors are used now. There are alternative RCA jacks from Keystone, which fit the same footprint (see BOM). Because of the new layout, a new case was required, too. There are recessions on the bottom shell for the solder pads, which have chancged in this board revision.
